# Portfolio 

Personal Portfolio website initially built during week 2 of my software development course at \_nology and then continually updated as I improved my skills on the course and completed more projects. 

Responsive on PC or Mobile. 

## Design 

The wireframe for the project was designed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/UQ7NcCBE9NScccttfMR9e2/Portfolio---Week-1?node-id=0%3A1). 

I endeavoured to get a 1:1 recreation of the wireframe during development and I think I got it pretty close. 
As time went on, I adapted the design to accomodate for responsiveness and to better present the information.
